To deploy this application to Heroku, use this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Or, if you'd prefer to use the command line, try running:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/RoPP/todo-backend-rustful.git
cd todo-backend-rustful
heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust.git
git push heroku master
```

This should make a local copy of this application and deploy it to Heroku.

For further instructions, see

### Does this work with the latest version of Rust?

This application works with version 1.0.0-beta.4 of Rust, which
theoretically means that any future language breakage should be minimal.
However, Iron's API is not yet officially stable.

If this is green, then you should be able to install the latest Rust
compiler, run `cargo update` and build this code successfully:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emk/todo-backend-rustful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emk/todo-backend-rustful)

(Note that we only check the build once per day, so it's possible that
things have broken since the latest build.)

If the build is failing, you have two choices:

1. Install Rust and Cargo from the URLs listed in the `RustConfig` file and
   refrain from running `cargo update`.
2. Update the code to work with the latest release of Rust.  Please feel
   free to send me a pull request!

### Does this work with Cloud Foundry?

The application can be deployed to Cloud Foundry as an alternative to
Heroku. From the command line, run:

``` sh
cd todo-backend-rustful
cf push todo-backend-rustful -b https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust.git
```
